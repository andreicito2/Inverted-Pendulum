## Features:
- Full State Observer
- LQR Control 
- Octave


## Control Approach:
Our Project uses state-space feedback controller designed using modern control theory, using:

- Real-time state estimation
- Robust control tuning using matrix-based gain design
- Manual gain tuning

## Future Work:
 - Adding Second Pendulum
 - Removing resonance spots 
 - Recentering the cart after it drifts because of balancing
 - Removing drift while balancing
