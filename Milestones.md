# Project Milestones: Inverted Pendulum Control System
Below are our project milestones for the inverted pendulum control system. Many weeks lined up with our original milestones, but there were a few that differed, especially near the end. As such the original milestones will be listed first, then an appended version will be added after, if necessary.

## Week 1-2: Background and Theory
- Attended lectures on control systems fundamentals
- Studied inverted pendulum dynamics and state-space modeling
- Reviewed LQR (Linear Quadratic Regulator) theory

## Week 3: System Modeling
- Derived equations of motion for the inverted pendulum
- Linearized the system and developed the state-space model
- Documented derivation and assumptions

### Actual week 3:
- Derived equations of motion for the inverted pendulum
- Linearized the system and developed the state-space model
- Documented derivation and assumptions
- Read through provided code (system parameters and ctrlbox code)

## Week 4: Simulation Environment Setup
- Installed required Python libraries (numpy, matplotlib, control, scipy)
- Set up Jupyter Notebook for simulation and documentation
- Verified environment with simple test scripts

## Week 5: Controller Design
- Designed LQR controller for the linearized system
- Selected Q and R matrices and analyzed closed-loop poles
- Simulated open-loop and closed-loop responses

## Week 6: Observer Design
- Designed a state observer (Luenberger observer)
- Simulated observer performance with noisy measurements
- Compared estimated and true states

## Week 7: Full System Simulation
- Integrated controller and observer in simulation
- Ran full closed-loop simulations with initial perturbations
- Visualized results with plots and animations

### Actual Week 7:

## Week 8: Hardware/Embedded Preparation (if applicable)
- Prepared code for embedded deployment (e.g., PlatformIO project setup)
- Reviewed hardware requirements and constraints

### Actual Week 8:
- Finalized code for the single inverted pendulum
- Tuned and optimized controller and observer parameters
- Improved simulation accuracy and documentation

## Week 9: Testing and Validation
- Performed extensive simulation testing
- Validated controller and observer performance under various scenarios
- Documented results and troubleshooting steps

### Actual Week 9:
- Began work on modeling and simulating a double/inverted pendulum system
- Attempted to extend controller and observer design to the second pendulum
- Documented challenges and initial results

## Week 10: Finalization and Reporting
- Compiled results and prepared final report
- Created README and documentation (derivations, code, usage)

## Week 11: Presentation
- Presented project outcomes to class/instructor
- Addressed questions and discussed results
